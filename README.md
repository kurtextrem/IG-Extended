# Improved Layout for Instagram.com

The default Instagram.com layout is not optimized for the desktop. This extension improves this.

Download from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nekeeojpcbiehcignddhindbgacbghmi).

## Development

Do you want to help with developing? You're very welcome.

To get this extension running (if you're a dev), follow these steps:

1.  Download the [ZIP](https://github.com/kurtextrem/Twitch5/archive/master.zip) archive of the repository.
2.  Unpack somewhere.
3.  Run `npm install` in the folder _(make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed)_

To load the Extension in Chrome follow these steps:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Chrome</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<ol>
				<li>Open <code>chrome://extensions</code>
				<li>Check the <strong>Developer mode</strong> checkbox
				<li>Click on the <strong>Load unpacked extension</strong> button
				<li>Select the <code>src</code> folder (<code>where-you-unpacked-the-ZIP/src</code>)
			</ol>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### Starting the Dev Server

1.  Run `npm run start`
2.  Open the Options page (right click the Extension Icon in Chrome)

It will auto reload when you do changes in `src/components`.

This also works if you want to debug CSS/JS on Instagram.com.

I'm always available to help!
